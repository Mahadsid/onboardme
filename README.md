# OnBoardMe to [mac, mint]
I have enough productivity tools and special configs for various programs that I actually need a repo for it at this point, and I transfer from Linux to Mac enough, that I need to manage like 5 package managers, at least. The state of personal development software is terrible.

## MINT
Under construction, but the idea is that we keep the best of both worlds, and just have one script to support both OSes. And even better, it's run via like ansible and dockerized. The basic dev machine goal :blue_heart:

### Installation
Totally manual and awful.

### Note
Theorectically, most of the config and setup for mint, also works for Ubuntu and other debian based systems, but YMMV.

## MAC
### Installation
*Install the Required Python packages*
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

*Run the script*
`./onboardme.py`

**You did it! :D **
Here, have some free wallpapers from my old Google Pixel <3

* KEYBOARD MAPPINGS: CAPS TO CONTROL
