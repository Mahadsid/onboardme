# onboardme
I have enough productivity tools and special configs for various programs that I actually need a repo for it at this point

# TODO: 
* alfred: get better URLs like 'latest' or something for these hardcoded globals
* add functioning arg parser
* process brew files from.... brew... file?
* Personal settings for iterm/alfred
* KEYBOARD MAPPINGS: CAPS TO CONTROL

# How To
*Install the Required Python packages*
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

*Run the script*
`./onboardme.py`

You did it!
