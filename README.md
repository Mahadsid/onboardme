# onboardme
I have enough productivity tools and special configs for various programs that I actually need a repo for it at this point

# TODO: 
* alfred: get better URLs like 'latest' or something for these hardcoded globals
* add option for custom install dir
* add functioning arg parser
* process brew files like someone who gets sleep at night
* Personal settings for iterm/alfred
* KEYBOARD MAPPINGS: CAPS TO CONTROL
* actually explain how to use the script in the readme....
* figure out why my svn no work... it was so hopeful...
