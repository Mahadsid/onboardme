App | Local Config | Link | Pros | Cons
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
hyper.js|[../../configs/rc_files/.hyper.js](../../configs/rc_files/.hyper.js)|[hyper.is](https://hyper.is/)|modern feel, configurable|Slow :(
cmder|None|*[cmder](https://cmder.net/)|terminal for windows that scales, splits, and supports config|kinda buggy

You can find more Hyper.js docs [here](./hyper/README.md), thanks to @cloudymax :)
