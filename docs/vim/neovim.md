# neovim
[Neovim](https://neovim.io) is 

> a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more. 

It's supposed to be faster than vim at a lot of things, and there's more 
extensible plugins and active communities, it would seem anyway, from my casual
observation over the past year-ish (it's October 2022 at the time of writing).

To be honest, I've been using vim since 2012, and even though neovim has been
around since 2015, since I was using vi before vim, I never really gave it a
ton of thought. But recently there finally came a plugin that looked too good
not to try, but was only available for neovim, so I figured, at very least,
I should give it a go. I'll document anything interesting I learn here.

You can install neovim with: `brew install neovim`

You can run neovim with: `nvim`

## Config

The config file is located at:

|        OS          |                   Location                     |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| Unix               | ~/.config/nvim/init.vim		(or init.lua)     |
| Windows            | ~/AppData/Local/nvim/init.vim	(or init.lua) |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/nvim/init.vim	(or init.lua) |

And if you want to just get your vim stuff working, you want to these contents:

```vim
set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
let &packpath = &runtimepath
source ~/.vimrc
```

After that, launch neovim with `nvim` and then do your normal plugin manager flow.

(For instance: `:PlugInstall` for vim-plug users)

Most plugins will work out of the box, but you'll probably have issues with:

### Python / Python3 Plugins

If you run into a bunch of errors about vim not being compiled with python3,
then you probably need to first install `pynvim`, which helps with this:

```bash
python3.10 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim
```

After that, all my plugins worked find as they do in vim.

## Known issues

If you get an error complaining about `bash\ --login`, then it's probably
because of this line in your .vimrc:

```vim
" this works in vim, but not neovim
set shell=bash\ --login
```

Fix it by changing the above to:

```vim
" this ignores neovim when setting shell
if !has('nvim')
    set shell=bash\ --login
endif
```
