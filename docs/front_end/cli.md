# Frontend Stuff
I found [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68558955/bootstrap-centering-container-in-the-middle-of-the-page)
on vertically centering items and it helped a lot. Basically both the body and
base container you have need to be h-100 and vh-100 and for extra security,
add `min-height: 100vh;` to the CSS for the body.
