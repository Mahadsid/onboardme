# python 0.13.10a4

ðŸŽˆ We have a pypi package now! :D onboardme wasn't taken!

You can now view the project at:
[pypi.org/project/onboardme](https://pypi.org/project/onboardme)

And install with: `pip3.10 install onboardme` ðŸ’™

We've also introduced more proper semantic versioning, so you will see `a[0-99]` at the end of many of our versions until we are sure
that the API is legitmately stable enough to move to proper beta.

- there is a solid `config.yml` that is used for both user config and core config. You can install it into `~/onboardme/config.yml`
- ripped out most of the untested or not working code around browsers, cron, and email for now.
- new options:
  - `--overwrite`  -  allows you to overwrite existing files in your home directory that may conflict with the dot files in the remote git repo that's been configured
  - `--git_url`    -  url of git repo to use for dot files
  - `--git_branch` -  branch of the configured git repo to use
  - `--log_level`  - set the logging level for the script
  - `--log_file`   - log to a file to check the results later
- updated docs to have more recent screenshots
- updated python syntax highlighting files for vim as well as the custom colorscheme
- moved complicated user config processing to it's own file for maintanability
- updated the jekyll docs to use github pages markdown formatting
- updated the license from GPLv3 to Affero.
